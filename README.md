## Prepare environment
Prepare the environment for deep learning according to the documents in the folder [environment](https://github.com/ykaitao/dl-global/tree/master/environment)
## Tutorial
Study the deep learning tutorial by reading:
- [Code](https://github.com/ykaitao/dl-global/tree/master/examples/Theano)
- [PDF](https://github.com/ykaitao/dl-global/blob/master/Deep%20learning%20tutorials.pdf)
## Five popular Deep Learning frameworks
- CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks
- SdA: Stacked de-noising Auto-encoder
- DBN: [Deep Belief Networks](http://blog.csdn.net/itplus/article/details/19168989) 
- RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks
- LSTM: [Long-Short Term Memory](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
## Examples
Make the official examples of several machine learning / deep learning packages working. There examples are in the folder [examples](https://github.com/ykaitao/dl-global/tree/master/examples)
